 WhatsApp Web Help Center â€“ Confluence Project

This is a sample documentation space created in Confluence as part of my technical writing practice.

### ðŸ“‚ What it includes:
- âœ… Help articles written in a clean, user-friendly layout
- âœ… Internal page links for easy navigation
- âœ… FAQ and task-based documentation
- âœ… Organized sidebar structure (as shown in the screenshot)

### ðŸ›  Tools Used:
- Confluence (Cloud)
- Formatting features like headings, hyperlinks, and layout blocks

This project simulates a help center like those used in SaaS platforms to support users.
